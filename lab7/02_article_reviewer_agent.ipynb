    "The core functionality of a reflection agent is to perform evaluation and refinement of the output through a feedback loop. In our previous lab (Lab 4), we implemented an PR Reviewer Agent responsible for reviewing PR articles. Now in Lab 5, we are applying those reflection concepts to implement an News Article Reviewer Agent that critically evaluates the generated output, identifying potential errors, inconsistencies, or areas for improvement. During this phase, the agent acts as its own critic, scrutinizing the quality, accuracy, and appropriateness of its response.\n",
