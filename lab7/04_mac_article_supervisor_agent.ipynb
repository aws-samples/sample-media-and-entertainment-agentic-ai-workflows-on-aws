    "In the previous notebooks, we built two specialized agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Article Generation Agent** (Notebook 02): An expert content creator that writes high-quality news, sports, and entertainment articles following detailed journalistic guidelines. This agent focuses on clarity, accuracy, engagement, structure, balance, and technical excellence.\n",
    "2. **Article Reviewer Agent** (Notebook 03): A professional reviewer that analyzes articles across multiple dimensions including readability, factual accuracy, engagement, fairness, context, and ethical considerations. This agent provides detailed, constructive feedback with specific improvement suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll implement a **Multi-Agent Collaboration** pattern by creating a supervisor agent that orchestrates these two specialized agents to work together iteratively. This pattern enables a powerful feedback loop where content is continuously refined through expert review cycles.\n",

    "- Delegation of specific tasks to agents with specialized expertise\n",
    "- Iterative improvement through feedback loops\n",

    "\n",
    "The supervisor agent we'll create will:\n",
    "1. Receive the initial article request from the user\n",
    "2. Delegate article creation to the Article Generation Agent\n",
    "3. Send the draft to the Article Reviewer Agent for critique\n",
    "4. Return the draft to the Article Generation Agent with feedback\n",
    "5. Repeat steps 2-4 up to three times to refine the article\n",
    "6. Deliver the final polished article to the user\n",

    "\n",
    "In this lab, we demonstrated how to implement a powerful **Multi-Agent Collaboration** pattern using Amazon Bedrock Agents. This pattern enables complex workflows through the orchestration of specialized agents working together to achieve superior results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation consisted of three key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Article Generation Agent**: A specialized content creator that produces high-quality articles following detailed journalistic guidelines across multiple dimensions including clarity, accuracy, engagement, structure, and technical excellence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Article Reviewer Agent**: A professional reviewer that analyzes content across multiple dimensions and provides detailed, constructive feedback with specific improvement suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Article Supervisor Agent**: The orchestrator that coordinates the collaboration between the specialized agents, managing the iterative feedback loop to continuously refine the article quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multi-agent collaboration pattern demonstrated several key advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent focuses on its core competency - content creation or critical review\n",
    "- **Iterative Improvement**: The feedback loop enables continuous refinement of the content\n",
    "- **Workflow Automation**: The supervisor agent manages the entire process without requiring user intervention\n",
    "- **Quality Enhancement**: The final output benefits from multiple perspectives and expertise\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern can be extended to many other domains where complex workflows require different specialized capabilities working in concert. By breaking down complex tasks into specialized roles and establishing clear communication protocols between agents, we can build powerful AI systems that deliver higher quality results than any single agent could achieve independently.\n"
