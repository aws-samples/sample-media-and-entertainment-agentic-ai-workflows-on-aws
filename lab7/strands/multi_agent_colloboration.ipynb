    "# Multi-agent Collaboration - News Writer\n",
    "When you need more than a single agent to handle a complex task, you can create additional specialized agents to address different aspects of the process. However, managing these agents becomes technically challenging as tasks grow in complexity. As a developer using open source solutions, you may find yourself navigating the complexities of agent orchestration, session handling, memory management, and other technical aspects that require manual implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the multi-agent collaboration capability on Strands Agents SDK, specialized agents work within their domain of expertise, coordinated by a supervisor agent. The supervisor breaks down requests, delegates tasks, and consolidates outputs into a final response. For example, an investment advisory multi-agent system might include agents specialized in financial data analysis, research, forecasting, and investment recommendations. Similarly, a retail operations multi-agent system could handle demand forecasting, inventory allocation, supply chain coordination, and pricing optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will build a multi-agent system where facts about a news event collected by a journalist are used to generate a news story. As shown in the diagram below, multiple agents will be responsible for tasks which are orchestrated by the supervisor agent:"

    "5. The Lambda then returns the research to the Research agent, which returns it to the Interface Supervisor agent.\n",
    "6. Once additional context has been provided by the Research agent, the Interface Supervisor agent sends the research and the facts to the Article Generation agent. This agent is part of a reflection pattern we covered earlier (Lab 5):\n",
    "   1. News Generation agent: This writes the main news article based on the information provided by the Research agent.\n",
    "   2. Article Reviewer agent: This provides feedback to the News Generation agent and together, these agents iteratively improve the quality of the generated article.\n",

    "Please note that this is a simplified architecture to demonstrate multi-agent collaboration, a complete architecture would incorporate storing outputs at every stage for monitoring agents, and more opportunity for human-in-the-loop capability."

      "NeuraHealth Solutions announced its new medical diagnostic platform called \"MediScan\" at their annual developer conference yesterday. The system demonstrated 94% accuracy in early disease detection across a trial of 12,000 patients. Dr. Eliza Chen, Chief Medical Officer at NeuraHealth, revealed the system was trained on 50 million anonymized patient records. NeuraHealth CEO Marcus Williams stated the company invested $450 million in R&D over three years. The platform will be piloted at five major hospital networks next month. SVP Raj Patel confirmed FDA approval expected Q3. Initial focus: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, early cancer detection.<thinking>\n",
      "The extract_entities tool has successfully identified five key entities from the news facts: NeuraHealth Solutions (organization), MediScan (product), Dr. Eliza Chen (person), Marcus Williams (person), and Raj Patel (person).

      "3. Dr. Eliza Chen: Should gather professional credentials and role specifics\n",
      "4. Marcus Williams: Look for leadership history and strategic vision\n",
      "5. Raj Patel: Need information about regulatory affairs expertise and FDA interactions\n",

    "\n",
    "In this lab, we demonstrated how to implement a powerful **Multi-Agent Collaboration** pattern using Strands SDK. This pattern enables complex workflows through the orchestration of specialized agents working together to achieve superior results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation consisted of four key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Research Agent**: A specialized agent which can extract entities from news facts and provide detailed research on each entity to help write a balanced news article.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Article Generation Agent**: A specialized content creator that produces high-quality articles following detailed journalistic guidelines across multiple dimensions including clarity, accuracy, engagement, structure, and technical excellence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Article Reviewer Agent**: A professional reviewer that analyzes content across multiple dimensions and provides detailed, constructive feedback with specific improvement suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Interface Supervisor Agent**: This orchestrates the whole workflow of passing information from the user to the research and generation agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multi-agent collaboration pattern demonstrated several key advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent focuses on its core competency - content creation or critical review\n",
    "- **Iterative Improvement**: The feedback loop enables continuous refinement of the content\n",
    "- **Workflow Automation**: The supervisor agent manages the entire process without requiring user intervention\n",
    "- **Quality Enhancement**: The final output benefits from multiple perspectives and expertise\n",
