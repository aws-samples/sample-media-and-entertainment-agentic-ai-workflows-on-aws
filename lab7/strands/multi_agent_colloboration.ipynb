    "# Multi-agent Collaboration - News Writer\n",
    "When you need more than a single agent to handle a complex task, you can create additional specialized agents to address different aspects of the process. However, managing these agents becomes technically challenging as tasks grow in complexity. As a developer using open source solutions, you may find yourself navigating the complexities of agent orchestration, session handling, memory management, and other technical aspects that require manual implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the multi-agent collaboration capability on Strands Agents SDK, specialized agents work within their domain of expertise, coordinated by a supervisor agent. The supervisor breaks down requests, delegates tasks, and consolidates outputs into a final response. For example, an investment advisory multi-agent system might include agents specialized in financial data analysis, research, forecasting, and investment recommendations. Similarly, a retail operations multi-agent system could handle demand forecasting, inventory allocation, supply chain coordination, and pricing optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will build a multi-agent system where facts about a news event collected by a journalist are used to generate a news story. As shown in the diagram below, multiple agents will be responsible for tasks which are orchestrated by the supervisor agent:\n",

    "   1. Entity Extraction: These can be people, companies, products, etc.\n",
    "   2. Gather background information: This uses the Bedrock Knowledge Base we created in the setup phase. If any entity has low confidence scores, i.e. not mentioned anywhere in the Knowledge Base it is discarded.\n",
    "5. The Lambda then returns the research to the Research agent, which returns it to the Interface Supervisor agent.\n",
    "6. Once additional context has been provided by the Research agent, the Interface Supervisor agent sends the research and the facts to the Article Generation agent. This agent is part of a reflection pattern we covered earlier (Lab 5):\n",
    "   1. News Generation agent: This writes the main news article based on the information provided by the Research agent.\n",
    "   2. Article Reviewer agent: This provides feedback to the News Generation agent and together, these agents iteratively improve the quality of the generated article.\n",
    "7. The remainder of the architecture is shown for completeness, and won't be part of this lab. Feel free to implement that if you have time at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that this is a simplified architecture to demonstrate multi-agent collaboration, a complete architecture would incorporate storing outputs at every stage for monitoring agents, and more opportunity for human-in-the-loop capability."

    "1. **Research Agent**: A specialized agent which can extract entities from news facts and provide detailed research on each entity to help write a balanced news article.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Article Generation Agent**: A specialized content creator that produces high-quality articles following detailed journalistic guidelines across multiple dimensions including clarity, accuracy, engagement, structure, and technical excellence.\n",
