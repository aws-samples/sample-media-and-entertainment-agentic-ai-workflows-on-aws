    "In the previous notebooks, we demonstrated 2 agents where the first agent is designed to write a article for an upcoming release of a new show/movie. The second agent is created to review and critiques the output from the first agent, and give suggestions to improve the quality based on the specific guidelines. In this notebook, we'll focus on connecting these agents together so that the process of writing and reviewing process could be performed iteratively to build the highest quality PR article. \n",

These secondary agents can be any existing agent within the same account, including agents that have collaboration themselves. \n",

First, we built a PR writer agent responsible for curating a PR article by giving it access to a knowledge base that contains a repository of prestine articles as reference. Next, we built a PR reviewer agent that performs review and suggestions to improve the quality of the PR article. Finally, we built a supervisor agent that leverages the collaboration between these 2 agents to improve the quality of the PR article iteratively. The final PR article is returned to the user. "
