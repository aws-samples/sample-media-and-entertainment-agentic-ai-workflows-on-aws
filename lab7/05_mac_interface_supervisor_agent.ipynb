    "## Interface Supervisor Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebooks, we built three specialized agents and a supervisor agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Researach Agent** (Notebook 01): An expert at identifying entities in facts gathered from a news event, and then researching the background of those entities to produce data that can assist in writing a news story\n",
    "2. **Article Generation Agent** (Notebook 02): An expert content creator that writes high-quality news, sports, and entertainment articles following detailed journalistic guidelines. This agent focuses on clarity, accuracy, engagement, structure, balance, and technical excellence.\n",
    "3. **Article Reviewer Agent** (Notebook 03): A professional reviewer that analyzes articles across multiple dimensions including readability, factual accuracy, engagement, fairness, context, and ethical considerations. This agent provides detailed, constructive feedback with specific improvement suggestions.\n",
    "4. **Article Supervisor Agent** (Notebook 03): A supervisor agent that orchestrates the article generator and reviewer specialized agents to work together iteratively. This pattern enables a powerful feedback loop where content is continuously refined through expert review cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll implement an Interface Supervisor agent that applies a multi-agent collaboration pattern to communicate between the user, research agent, and article generation supervisor agent.\n",

    "[Multi-agent Collaboration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-multi-agents-collaboration.html) is an Amazon Bedrock Agents capability that enables hierarchical collaboration between agents. This pattern allows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A supervisor agent to coordinate specialized sub-agents\n",
    "- Delegation of specific tasks to agents with specialized expertise\n",
    "- Iterative improvement through feedback loops\n",
    "- Complex workflows that leverage multiple AI capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "The supervisor agent we'll create will:\n",
    "1. Receive the initial news facts regarding a news event from the user\n",
    "2. Delegates verification and research around entities identified in the news facts to the Research Agent\n",
    "2. The output of the research agents is then sent to the Article Generation Supervisor, who uses the reflection pattern to iteratively produce a new story.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. **Research Agent**: A specialized agent which can extract entities from news facts and provide detailed research on each entity to help write a balanced news article.\n",
