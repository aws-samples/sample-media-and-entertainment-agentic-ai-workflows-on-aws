Create a query for an LLM that asks to find research material on the entities indentified in the news facts.\n\nSkip the preamble, your output should only include the query and nothing else.\n\nYour response must start with:\n\"Conduct indepth research about only the list of entities under the 'Entities' heading provided in markdown format at the end of this input. Find as much relevant research material of a commercial, personal, financial nature as possible. Focus on all types of information which can help in writing a news article about the entities. Only add information if it is in the knowledge base. If an entity isn't found in your knowledge base, discard it from the output.\"\n\nTo the start, add the following regarding output format:\n\"Output Format\nStructure output in two headings in consistent markdown format. The first heading will be titled \"Researched Entities\" and it will be a list of only those entities for which you found research information. Each entity should only have the following attributes:\nentity_id: unique identifier\ntext: extracted text of the entity\ntype: PERSON or ORGANIZATION or PRODUCT\nsubtype: specific classification\nconfidence: confidence score\nresearch: \n - research item 1\n - research item 2\n - more research items\n\nThe second heading will be titled \"New Facts\" and will be followed by the original \"News Facts\" that were given to you.\n\nMake sure to include proper line breaks by:\n1. Using a blank line between paragraphs\n2. Adding two spaces at the end of lines where you want a soft line break\n3. Using proper markdown syntax for lists, headings, and other elements that require specific line formatting.\"\n\nFinally, add the list that must be researched as is:\n{{entities}}\n\n\nYour output must be limited to the query that you've constructed for the LLM and nothing more. Do not add any preamble."
