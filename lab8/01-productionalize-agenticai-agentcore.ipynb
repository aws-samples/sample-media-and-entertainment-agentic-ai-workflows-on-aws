    "# Productionize Agentic AI Applications Using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Successfully deploying AI agents to production requires a comprehensive set of capabilities that go far beyond basic model inference. This lab demonstrates the **essential production-grade components** needed for enterprise agentic workloads:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Infrastructure & Deployment Foundation**\n",
    "- **Containerized Deployment**: Package agents with all dependencies in Docker containers for consistent, portable deployments across environments\n",
    "- **Managed Runtime Environment**: AgentCore Runtime provides auto-scaling, health monitoring, and resource management without infrastructure overhead\n",
    "- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Readiness**: Configuration-driven deployments that integrate seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines\n",
    "- \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Enterprise Security & Identity Management**\n",
    "- **Multi-Tenant Session Isolation**: Each user session runs in dedicated microVMs with isolated compute, memory, and filesystem resources\n",
    "- **Industry-Standard Authentication**: Support for OAuth 2.0, JWT tokens, API keys, and AWS Sigv4 for flexible identity integration\n",
    "- **Credential Management**: Secure handling of access tokens and service credentials without exposing sensitive information\n",
    "- **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions through IAM roles and policies, ensuring agents operate with least-privilege principles\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Production Observability & Monitoring**\n",
    "- **Real-Time Metrics**: Track invocation counts, latency, error rates, throttling, and resource utilization across all agent operations\n",
    "- **Hierarchical Tracing**: Four-tier observability model (Runtime â†’ Sessions â†’ Traces â†’ Spans) providing complete visibility into agent execution\n",
    "- **OpenTelemetry Compatibility**: Standards-based telemetry integration with existing monitoring stacks and enterprise observability tools\n",
    "- **Visual Debugging**: CloudWatch dashboards with trace timelines, error breakdowns, and performance analytics for rapid troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Scalability & Performance Optimization**\n",
    "- **Automatic Scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation based on demand without manual intervention\n",
    "- **Session-Based Resource Management**: Efficient resource utilization through intelligent session lifecycle management\n",
    "- **Cross-Session Data Protection**: Memory sanitization and resource cleanup preventing data leakage between user sessions\n",
    "- **Optimized Execution Paths**: Performance monitoring and optimization capabilities for production workload efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Objectives\n",
    "In this lab, we'll transform the local multi-agent system from lab7 into a **production-ready application** deployed on [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/agents-tools-runtime.html). You'll master:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This lab depends on the completion of the Strands Agent in lab7. Please complete lab7 before running this particular lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow shown in the diagram above is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A journalist submits facts to a front-end backed by an LLM (Interface Supervisor)\n",
    "2. The Interface Supervisor agent sends the facts to a Research agent.\n",
    "3. The Research agent is equipped with a Tool that does the following:\n",
    "   1. Entity Extraction: These can be people, companies, products, etc.\n",
    "   2. Gather background information: This uses the Bedrock Knowledge Base we created in the setup phase. If any entity has low confidence scores, i.e. not mentioned anywhere in the Knowledge Base it is discarded.\n",
    "4. The Lambda then returns the research to the Research agent, which returns it to the Interface Supervisor agent.\n",
    "5. Once additional context has been provided by the Research agent, the Interface Supervisor agent sends the research and the facts to the Article Generation agent. This agent is part of a reflection pattern we covered earlier (Lab 5):\n",
    "   1. News Generation agent: This writes the main news article based on the information provided by the Research agent.\n",
    "   2. Article Reviewer agent: This provides feedback to the News Generation agent and together, these agents iteratively improve the quality of the generated article.\n",
    "6. The remainder of the architecture is shown for completeness, and won't be part of this lab. Feel free to implement that if you have time at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Architecture\n",
    "Let's review the architecture of the agent that we built in lab7. In the following section, we will describe how to deploy an existing agent to AgentCore runtime with all the production-grade capabilities outlined above.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:left\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"../imgs/lab8-strands-local.png\" width=\"80%\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture transforms from a local development environment to a **cloud-native, enterprise-ready deployment** that demonstrates industry best practices for production AI agent systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Turn On AgentCore Observability\n",
    "In this lab, we'll be using the AgentCore Observability feature to help us trace the agent orchestrations. Make sure you've turned on `Transaction Search` in Cloudwatch before running the notebook in this lab. For more information, please refer to this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability-configure.html).\n",

A session contains multiple traces, with each trace representing a discrete interaction within the broader context of the session. Each trace, in turn, contains multiple spans that capture the fine-grained operations and steps within that interaction. This hierarchical structure allows you to analyze agent behavior at different levels of granularity, from high-level session patterns to mid-level interaction flows to detailed execution paths for specific operations.\n",

This granularity is particularly valuable when troubleshooting complex issues or optimizing performance in sophisticated agent implementations.\n",
