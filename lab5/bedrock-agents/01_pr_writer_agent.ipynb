    "# Reflection Agent\n",
    "As the name suggests, *Reflection* is an AI design pattern where the goal is to iteratively refine the output of an LLM based on a given task. In practice, a reflection workflow typically involves an LLM generation, followed by a reflection, which in itself is another LLM generation conditioned on the output of the first one. For example, given a task to write an article, the first LLM can generate a draft, and the second LLM can generate a critique of the draft article.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Reflection pattern can be depicted in the following diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../imgs/reflection-pattern.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps shown in the above diagram are defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User initiates a task request, e.g. Write a blog post\n",
    "2. An agent receives the request, routes to the Generator LLM for the generation task. Optionally, the Generator LLM could use a Tool (e.g. knowledge base) to assist in the generation task.\n",
    "3. The LLM responds with an initial draft.\n",
    "4. An agent evaluates the initial response, then invokes a Reviewer LLM to reflect on the work from the Generation LLM. The Reviewer LLM critiques the given draft, and responds with suggestions for improvements. Optionally, the Reviewer LLM could use a tool to assist in the reviewing process.\n",
    "5. An agent receives the response from Reviewer LLM, evaluates the response. It either sends it to the Generator LLM to incorporate the suggestions, or is satisfied with the latest version of the work. This process could iterate multiple times until the Reviewer LLM approves the generated work.\n",
    "6. The agent returns the final response to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 agents involved in building this solution: A Generator agent, a Reviewer agent and a Supervisor agent that delegates the tasks between the first two agents. The Generator agent will generate a Press Release (PR) document, and the Reviewer agent will generate a critique of the PR work done by the Generator agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll implement the reflection pattern by using Bedrock Agents. The main task in this example is to create a PR article for an upcoming release of a movie.\n",

    "Amazon Bedrock Agents offers you the ability to build and configure autonomous agents in your application. An agent helps your end-users complete actions based on organization data and user input. Agents orchestrate interactions between foundation models (FMs), data sources, software applications, and user conversations. In addition, agents automatically call APIs to take actions and invoke knowledge bases to supplement information for these actions. \n",

    "First, we are going to create a PR generator agent. This agent is responsible for creating a draft PR for an upcoming movie release.\n",

    "Talent & Production Credentials: Highlight A-list actors, acclaimed directors, or award-winning crews. Mention prior successes (e.g., \"From the Oscar-winning producer of Parasite\").\n",
    "Behind-the-Scenes (BTS) Insights: Share filming locations, technical innovations, or adaptations (e.g., \"Shot in Iceland using cutting-edge VR cinematography\").\n",
