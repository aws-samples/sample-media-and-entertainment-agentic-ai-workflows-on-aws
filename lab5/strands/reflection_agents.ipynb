    "Example: \"A24 Reveals Trailer for Horror Thriller ‘Nightfall’ Starring Florence Pugh, Premiering October 2024.\"\n",
    "Highlight Exclusives: If applicable, note premieres at festivals (e.g., \"Sundance 2025 Official Selection\").\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Key Content Elements - Synopsis: Offer a 1–2 paragraph teaser without spoilers. Emphasize uniqueness (e.g., \"a dystopian love story set in 2140’s AI-dominated society\").\n",
    "Talent & Production Credentials: Highlight A-list actors, acclaimed directors, or award-winning crews. Mention prior successes (e.g., \"From the Oscar-winning producer of Parasite\").\n",
    "Behind-the-Scenes (BTS) Insights: Share filming locations, technical innovations, or adaptations (e.g., \"Shot in Iceland using cutting-edge VR cinematography\").\n",
