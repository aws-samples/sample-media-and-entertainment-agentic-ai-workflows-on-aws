## **SYNOPSIS: WHEN THE CLOCK IS THE ENEMY**  
**06:13:45 UTC**: Disgraced CIA cryptographer **Elena Voss** (**[A-List Actress‚Äôs Name]**) decodes an anonymous tip: a sleeper cell has infiltrated a nuclear summit, planning to assassinate seven world leaders in **45 seconds**. But there‚Äôs a catch‚Äîthe warning is encrypted in a cipher she invented‚Ä¶ and *only she knows it exists*.  

As global tensions skyrocket, Voss races across Berlin with rogue MI6 agent **Kai Mercer** (**[A-List Actor‚Äôs Name]**) to stop the countdown. But nothing is as it seems. The terrorists‚Äô demands change by the minute. The summit‚Äôs security chief (**[Renowned Actor‚Äôs Name]**) is leaking lies. And Voss‚Äôs own past holds a secret that could collapse the mission‚Äîand the world.  

With split-screen intensity and a ticking clock spliced into every frame, *45 Seconds to Midnight* forces audiences to ask: **Would you sacrifice a million lives to save a billion?**
