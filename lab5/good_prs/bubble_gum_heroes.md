In the glittering world of **Chroma City**, the magical **Rainbow Bridge** that links all colors to Earth‚Äôs creativity is under attack! Enter the **Bubblegum Heroes**‚Äîa squad of plucky, stretchy kids armed with enchanted gum that transforms into wild superpowers:  
- **Bounce** (voice of **[Celebrity Kid Actor]**) can inflate into a giant bouncy ball!  
- **Sticky** (voice of **[Celebrity Kid Actor]**) traps villains in gooey pink webs!  
- **Zap** (voice of **[Celebrity Kid Actor]**) shoots electric gumdrops from her bubble wand!  

But when the grumpy **Lord Grayscale** (voiced by **[A-List Comedian/Actor]**) drains the world of color to fuel his monotone empire, the Bubblegum Heroes must chew harder than ever! With time running out, they‚Äôll zip through rainbow slides, outwit grayscale goons, and learn that true teamwork is stickier than any gum. Will they re-color the world before everything turns to boring, chewy blah?
