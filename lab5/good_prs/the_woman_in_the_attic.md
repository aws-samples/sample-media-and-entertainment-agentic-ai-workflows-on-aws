## **SYNOPSIS: WHEN THE PAST WON’T STAY LOCKED AWAY**  
**Clara Whitlock** (**[A-List Actress’s Name]**), a historian reeling from her mother’s mysterious death, inherits the family’s crumbling Victorian estate. But beneath the dust and faded grandeur, she discovers a locked attic—and the faint sound of scratching at night. Defying warnings from the tight-lipped townsfolk, Clara pries open the door… and uncovers **Emmeline**, a spectral woman (**[Renowned Actress’s Name]**) chained to the rafters, repeating a single phrase: *“You were never supposed to come back.”*  

As Clara digs into Emmeline’s identity, she unravels a blood-soaked family secret spanning generations. But the deeper she ventures, the more the house resists: portraits bleed, voices echo through dumbwaiters, and Clara’s own reflection begins to change. Is Emmeline a victim? A vengeful ghost? Or a mirror of Clara’s darkest inheritance?

- **SOUNDSCAPE OF MADNESS**: A score woven from creaking floorboards, Victorian music boxes, and whispered confessionals.  
- **BASED ON TRUE FOLKLORE**: Inspired by 19th-century “attic prisoner” legends and the real unsolved disappearances of **[Region]**.  

**WARNING**: Test audiences reported checking their attics, silencing clocks, and sleeping with lights on for weeks.
