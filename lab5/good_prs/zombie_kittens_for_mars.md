## **SYNOPSIS: WHEN THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE HAS PAWS**  
When a rogue Martian laser pointer turns a litter of interstellar kittens into **zombified furballs of chaos**, Earth faces its fluffiest doomsday yet! Enter **Whisker Squadron 9**—a ragtag team of housecat heroes:  
- **Sir Floof** (voice of **[A-List Comedian]**), a tuxedo cat with a jetpack and delusions of grandeur.  
- **Toxie** (voice of **[Celebrity Voice Actor]**), a sassy Calico oozing neon-green zombie slime (and attitude).  
- **Mittens** (voice of **[Kid Actor]**), a wide-eyed kitten whose sneezes accidentally reanimate garden gnomes.  

To save humanity (and free the zombified pets of the world from Martian mind control), the squad must outsmart the **Galactic Litterbox Overlord**—a hairball-shaped alien AI—while dodging zombie squirrels, laser-chasing dogs, and the most terrifying threat of all: bath time.

## **WHY FAMILIES WILL GO WILD**  
- **ZOMBIES + KITTENS = COMEDY GOLD**: Watch zombified kittens weaponize cuteness (think brain-eating cuddles and hypno-purrs).  
- **EYE-POPPING ANIMATION**: A neon-soaked mix of 2D charm and 3D spectacle, with fur textures so real you’ll want to sneeze.  
- **CATCHY KARAOKE-READY TUNES**: From the punk-rock anthem *“Claw This Apocalypse!”* to the villain’s showstopping *“I’m the Litterboss, Baby!”*  
- **SNEAKY SMART THEMES**: Celebrates teamwork, embracing weirdness, and why even zombies deserve scritches.  

**PARENTAL WARNING**: Side effects may include endless “zombie kitten” cosplay, demands for glow-in-the-dark pets, and laughter-induced milk spills.
