# **The Uninvited Llama Wedding Crasher – The Comedy That’s 90% Llama, 100% Chaos, and 1,000% Hilarious!**  

## **This Summer, RSVP for Laughter. Dress Code: No Llama-Dodging Allowed!**  

Brace yourselves for the wildest wedding since someone said, “I do” to a pineapple at a luau! **"The Uninvited Llama Wedding Crasher"** storms theaters with a tornado of spit-takes, taco truck showdowns, and a fuzzy rebel you’ll wish was your plus-one. Directed by **Hank Rivera** (*"Goat Yoga Gone Wrong," "Duck Dynasty Dash"*) and starring **Alisha Vega** (*Disaster Date Diaries*) and **Marcus Finn** (*Cowboy Cupid*), this comedy is your front-row ticket to the most unhinged romp of the year.  

### **When “I Do” Becomes “Why’s That Llama Wearing a Veil?”**  

For meticulous event planner **Clara** (Alisha Vega), orchestrating a celebrity wedding at a swanky vineyard is her ticket to the big leagues. But her plans unravel faster than a cheap bridesmaid dress when **Lenny**, a rogue llama with a flair for drama, gatecrashes the festivities. Think *Wedding Crashers* meets *Dr. Dolittle*… if Dolittle lost his mind and adopted a furry anarchist.  

From trampling the floral arch to starting a TikTok dance craze (llama-style), Lenny’s antics threaten Clara’s career—until she reluctantly teams up with the vineyard’s disheveled, llama-whispering handyman **Travis** (Marcus Finn). But can they wrangle Lenny before he baptizes the bride in hummus dip? Spoiler: Chaos reigns. Hearts melt. Nobody’s shoes survive.  

### **Meet the Cast: Humans? Fine. Llama? Legend.**  
- **Alisha Vega** nails Clara’s journey from “I need a spreadsheet” to “I need a sedative.”  
- **Marcus Finn** brings rugged charm as Travis, a man who speaks fluent llama and zero pretentious wedding jargon.  
- **Lenny the Llama** steals every scene (and bouquet), with a résumé including “professional napkin thief” and “DJ Llama Llama Boom.”  

### **Director Hank Rivera Drops the Truth:**  
> “Lenny isn’t just a llama—he’s a metaphor for life. Sometimes you plan a perfect quinceañera, and life sends a farm animal to salsa dance on the piñata. Also, we taught a llama to play dead during vows. Art.”  

### **Why Audiences Will Cheers to This Comedy:**  
- **Unscripted Hilarity:** A llama-led karaoke rendition of “I Will Always Love Ewe.”  
- **Breathtaking Scenery:** New Zealand’s rolling hills—now with 50% more llama confetti.  
- **Feel-Good Feels:** Because love, laughter, and livestock make the best trifecta.  

### **Save the Date (And Your Confetti Cannons)!**  
**"The Uninvited Llama Wedding Crasher"** hijacks theaters **July 22nd**—perfect for date nights, girls’ nights, or anyone who’s ever side-eyed a wedding buffet.
