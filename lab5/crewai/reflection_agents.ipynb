    "- You should use the knowledge base to help with the style and structure for the article.\n",
    "- You are to follow the followoing best practices for writing the article:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Headline: Capture Attention & Key Details - Be Concise & Informative: Use active verbs like \"announces,\" \"debuts,\" or \"unveils.\" Include the title, release date/platform, and a hook (e.g., talent or franchise ties).\n",
    "Example: \"A24 Reveals Trailer for Horror Thriller ‘Nightfall’ Starring Florence Pugh, Premiering October 2024.\"\n",
    "Highlight Exclusives: If applicable, note premieres at festivals (e.g., \"Sundance 2025 Official Selection\").\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lead Paragraph: The 5 Ws - Summarize Who (studio, talent), What (title, genre), When (release date), Where (platforms/theaters), and Why (unique angle, legacy, or cultural relevance).\n",
    "Example: \"Marvel Studios’ ‘Avengers: Legacy,’ directed by Ryan Coogler, will premiere in theaters globally on May 3, 2025, marking the MCU’s first reboot of the iconic franchise.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Key Content Elements - Synopsis: Offer a 1–2 paragraph teaser without spoilers. Emphasize uniqueness (e.g., \"a dystopian love story set in 2140’s AI-dominated society\").\n",
    "Talent & Production Credentials: Highlight A-list actors, acclaimed directors, or award-winning crews. Mention prior successes (e.g., \"From the Oscar-winning producer of Parasite\").\n",
    "Behind-the-Scenes (BTS) Insights: Share filming locations, technical innovations, or adaptations (e.g., \"Shot in Iceland using cutting-edge VR cinematography\").\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Quotes: Add Authenticity - Source quotes from directors, leads, or producers that convey passion or vision.\n",
    "Example: \"‘This film redefines resilience,’ says director Jordan Peele. ‘We’re blending horror with social commentary in ways audiences haven’t seen.’\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Multimedia & Links - Embed or link to trailers, stills, and BTS content. Provide access to a password-protected media kit with HD assets.\n",
    "Include official social handles and hashtags (e.g., #NightfallMovie).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Tailor for Target Audiences - Trade Outlets (Deadline, Variety): Focus on box office prospects, production budgets, or industry trends.\n",
    "Lifestyle/Cultural Press (Vulture, Rolling Stone): Highlight themes, fashion, or soundtracks.\n",
    "Local Media: Tie in filming locations or local talent.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. SEO & Discoverability - Use keywords: Title, cast names, genre, and phrases like \"upcoming sci-fi movies 2025.\"\n",
    "Link to official sites or prior related content (e.g., a franchise’s timeline).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Logistics & Contact Info - Clearly state release platforms (e.g., \"Streaming exclusively on Netstream starting November 12\").\n",
    "List premiere events or fan screenings.\n",
    "Provide media contacts: Name, email, phone, and PR firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Professional Polish - Proofread: Ensure dates, names, and titles are error-free.\n",
    "Tone: Match the project’s vibe (e.g., playful for comedies, sleek for action).\n",
    "Style Guide: Adhere to outlet-specific rules (e.g., AP style).\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Follow-Up & Amplification - Pitch Exclusives: Offer early access to trailers or interviews for top-tier outlets.\n",
    "Post-Release: Monitor coverage, engage on social media, and update with new assets (e.g., poster drops).\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates a sophisticated multi-agent system using CrewAI that implements the reflection pattern for automated content generation. Key achievements:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Benefits\n",
    "- **Specialized Agents**: Each agent has a specific role (writing, reviewing, rewriting)\n",
    "- **Quality Control**: Built-in review and refinement cycles\n",
    "- **Scalable Workflow**: Hierarchical management enables complex task coordination\n",
    "- **AWS Integration**: Leverages Bedrock LLMs and Knowledge Bases for enhanced capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Implementation\n",
    "- **Multiple LLM Models**: Different models optimized for different tasks\n",
    "- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Context-aware content generation using example articles\n",
    "- **Iteration Control**: Prevents infinite refinement loops\n",
    "- **Tool Integration**: Custom tools for guidelines and best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "This pattern can be extended to other content generation scenarios:\n",
    "- Marketing copy creation and review\n",
    "- Technical documentation writing\n",
    "- Creative content development\n",
    "- Quality assurance workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "The reflection pattern ensures high-quality outputs through systematic review and refinement, making it ideal for professional content creation workflows."
