    "\n",
    "When writing the PR news, you should follow the following guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Headline: Capture Attention & Key Details - Be Concise & Informative: Use active verbs like \"announces,\" \"debuts,\" or \"unveils.\" Include the title, release date/platform, and a hook (e.g., talent or franchise ties).\n",
    "Example: \"A24 Reveals Trailer for Horror Thriller ‘Nightfall’ Starring Florence Pugh, Premiering October 2024.\"\n",
    "Highlight Exclusives: If applicable, note premieres at festivals (e.g., \"Sundance 2025 Official Selection\").\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lead Paragraph: The 5 Ws - Summarize Who (studio, talent), What (title, genre), When (release date), Where (platforms/theaters), and Why (unique angle, legacy, or cultural relevance).\n",
    "Example: \"Marvel Studios’ ‘Avengers: Legacy,’ directed by Ryan Coogler, will premiere in theaters globally on May 3, 2025, marking the MCU’s first reboot of the iconic franchise.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Key Content Elements - Synopsis: Offer a 1–2 paragraph teaser without spoilers. Emphasize uniqueness (e.g., \"a dystopian love story set in 2140’s AI-dominated society\").\n",
    "Talent & Production Credentials: Highlight A-list actors, acclaimed directors, or award-winning crews. Mention prior successes (e.g., \"From the Oscar-winning producer of Parasite\").\n",
    "Behind-the-Scenes (BTS) Insights: Share filming locations, technical innovations, or adaptations (e.g., \"Shot in Iceland using cutting-edge VR cinematography\").\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Quotes: Add Authenticity - Source quotes from directors, leads, or producers that convey passion or vision.\n",
    "Example: \"‘This film redefines resilience,’ says director Jordan Peele. ‘We’re blending horror with social commentary in ways audiences haven’t seen.’\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Multimedia & Links - Embed or link to trailers, stills, and BTS content. Provide access to a password-protected media kit with HD assets.\n",
    "Include official social handles and hashtags (e.g., #NightfallMovie).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Tailor for Target Audiences - Trade Outlets (Deadline, Variety): Focus on box office prospects, production budgets, or industry trends.\n",
    "Lifestyle/Cultural Press (Vulture, Rolling Stone): Highlight themes, fashion, or soundtracks.\n",
    "Local Media: Tie in filming locations or local talent.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. SEO & Discoverability - Use keywords: Title, cast names, genre, and phrases like \"upcoming sci-fi movies 2025.\"\n",
    "Link to official sites or prior related content (e.g., a franchise’s timeline).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Logistics & Contact Info - Clearly state release platforms (e.g., \"Streaming exclusively on Netstream starting November 12\").\n",
    "List premiere events or fan screenings.\n",
    "Provide media contacts: Name, email, phone, and PR firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Professional Polish - Proofread: Ensure dates, names, and titles are error-free.\n",
    "Tone: Match the project’s vibe (e.g., playful for comedies, sleek for action).\n",
    "Style Guide: Adhere to outlet-specific rules (e.g., AP style).\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Follow-Up & Amplification - Pitch Exclusives: Offer early access to trailers or interviews for top-tier outlets.\n",
    "Post-Release: Monitor coverage, engage on social media, and update with new assets (e.g., poster drops).\n",
    "\n",
    "You also have access to a knowledge base tool that contains pristine, high quality PRs that have been published in the past. You should use the knowledge base in assisting with the writing when no feedback was given.\n",
