    "# Agent with Tool Use\n",
    "One of the benefits of an agent is its ability to use Tools. Leveraging Tools enables agents to perform complex tasks beyond reasoning capabilities.\n",
    "When given a task, the agent evaluates the task requirements, then selects an appropriate Tool from its available toolkit, and strategically applies them to achieve specific goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process involves using the LLM to reason about tool selection, understanding how to properly utilize each Tool, and integrating the results back into the agent's workflow.\n",
    "In addition, agents could also be given access to external knowledge bases, interface with APIs to extend their problem-solving capability that can address a broader range of challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we are going to walk through an example of an agent with Tool use.\n",
    "This use case focuses on answering a user's questions about media assets. Media asset details, such as titles, plot, synopsis are types of information commonly stored and available in the title management systems of media companies. These details could be leveraged by an AI agent to gather the information about the titles based on a user's questions in natural language. While title information is stored in the knowledge base, there may be additional details relevant to titles that are not readily available, for instances, getting the latest movie ratings or reviews about the given title. An agent would need to access other internal / external sources, for instance, IMDB through web APIs to gather such details.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our lab, we demonstrate calling an API through a Tool that allows the agent to gather extra information. The combination of details from knowledge bases and the API completes the user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../imgs/agent-tooluse-architecture.png\" width=\"600\"> \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps shown in the above diagram are defined as followed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User initiates a task request. (e.g. Ask for a rating of a movie)\n",
    "2. An agent received the request, first extracts the media title information from the knowledge base.\n",
    "3. Based on the user query, the agent retrieves the rating information by invoking a Tool. The Tool makes an API {all that provides the rating information for a title given the title_id.\n",
    "4. The agent receives both the title and rating information for the given title.\n",
    "5. Agent returns the final response to the user."

    "# Define Agent Tools\n",
    "In the context of Bedrock Agents, Tools are organized as Action Groups. An Action Group defines actions that the agent can help the user perform. For example, you could define an action group called `Get the title rating via an API call` that helps users get the ratings of a given title.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Define the parameters and information that the agent must elicit from the user for each action in the Action Group to be carried out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decide how the agent handles the parameters and information that it receives from the user and where it sends the information it elicits from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about Action Groups, please refer to this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents-action-create.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Action Group supports functions that help the agent to fulfill a subtask. For instance, a function that invokes an external API to retrieve the rating of a title, or an API that retrieves the most recent reviews about a title.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function details consist of a list of parameters, defined by their name, data type (for a list of supported data types, see ParameterDetail), and whether they are required. The agent uses these configurations to determine what information it needs to elicit from the user. You can define the function detail in a JSON file with name, description, parameters, or provide a file in the OpenAPI compatible format.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fulfill the task, you can define a Lambda function to program the business logic for an Action Group. After a Amazon Bedrock agent determines the API operation that it needs to invoke in an Action Group, it sends information from the API schema alongside relevant metadata as an input event to the Lambda function. To write your function, you must understand the following components of the Lambda function:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input event – Contains relevant metadata and populated fields from the request body of the API operation or the function parameters for the action that the agent determines must be called.\n",

    "In this lab, we demonstrated how to build a Bedrock Agent as an AI assistant that helps users find media information efficiently. We first created a Knowledge Base for Bedrock, which contains the media details made available to the agent to find media title information. Additionally, we also created a Tool for the agent which provides real time media rating from an external system via an API call. Using these tools, the AI agent helps users answer relevant questions about the media assets in their media library / archive. In the next lab, we'll extend the agentic capabilities to incorporate multiple AI agents to work collaboratively to solve an even more complex problem. Go ahead and hop over to lab 7 to continue the workshop."
