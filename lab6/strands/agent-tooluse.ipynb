    "# Buding an Agent with Tool Use using Strands SDK and MCP\n",
    "One of the benefits of an agent is its ability to use Tools. Leveraging Tools enables agents to perform complex tasks beyond reasoning capabilities.\n",
    "When given a task, the agent evaluates the task requirements, then selects an appropriate Tool from its available toolkit, and strategically applies them to achieve specific goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process involves using the LLM to reason about tool selection, understanding how to properly utilize each Tool, and integrating the results back into the agent's workflow.\n",
    "In addition, agents could also be given access to external knowledge bases, interface with APIs to extend their problem-solving capability that can address a broader range of challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we are going to walk through an example of an agent with Tool use.\n",
    "This use case focuses on answering a user's questions about media assets. Media asset details, such as titles, plot, synopsis are types of information commonly stored and available in the title management systems of media companies. These details could be leveraged by an AI agent to gather the information about the titles based on a user's questions in natural language. While title information is stored in the knowledge base, there may be additional details relevant to titles that are not readily available, for instances, getting the latest movie ratings or reviews about the given title. An agent would need to access other internal / external sources, for instance, IMDB through web APIs to gather such details.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our lab, we demonstrate calling an API through a Tool that allows the agent to gather extra information. The combination of details from knowledge bases and the API completes the user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../imgs/lab6-strands-mcp.png\" width=\"800\"> \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps shown in the above diagram are defined as followed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User initiates a task request. (e.g. Ask for a rating of a movie)\n",
    "2. An agent received the request, first extracts the media title information from the knowledge base.\n",
    "3. Based on the user query, the agent retrieves the rating information by invoking a Tool. The Tool makes an API  that provides the rating information for a title given the title_id.\n",
    "4. The agent receives both the title and rating information for the given title.\n",
    "5. Agent returns the final response to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this noteebook, we'll implement the agentic application using [StrandsAgent SDK](https://strandsagents.com/latest/), and MCP server.  "

    "In this lab, we demonstrated how to build a Strands Agent as an AI assistant that helps users find media information efficiently. We first created a Knowledge Base for Bedrock, which contains the media details made available to the agent to find media title information. We use the [Knowledge Bases for Bedrock MCP server](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/servers/bedrock-kb-retrieval-mcp-server/) to connect to the knowledge base. Additionally, we connected to a [lambda MCP server](https://awslabs.github.io/mcp/servers/lambda-tool-mcp-server/) to the agent which provides real time media rating from an external system via an API call. Using these tools, the AI agent helps users answer relevant questions about the media assets in their media library / archive. "
