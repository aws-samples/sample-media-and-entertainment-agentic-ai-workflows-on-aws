    "# Build a Prompt Chaining Agentic Workflow Using CrewAI\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will build a chained prompts workflow using CrewAI Agentic Framework to intelligently process a legal contract, draft an email with concerns in the contract, and finally provide feedback on the email. Chaining prompts, which involves using the output of one prompt as input to another, offers several advantages when working with Large Language Models (LLMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Prompt Chaining\n",
    "Prompt chaining is a technique that involves breaking down a workflow into a series of known steps. Then orchestrates each step (typically involve an LLM invocation) to handle the output generated from the previous step. Within the worklow, there could be one or more conditional steps which determines the the trajectory of the workflow based on the given state.\n",
