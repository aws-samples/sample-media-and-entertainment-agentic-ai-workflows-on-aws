    "# Build a Prompt Chaining Agentic Workflow Using Strands Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will build a chained prompts workflow using Strands Agent to intelligently process a legal contract, draft an email with concerns in the contract, and finally provide feedback on the email. Chaining prompts, which involves using the output of one prompt as input to another, offers several advantages when working with Large Language Models (LLMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Prompt Chaining\n",
    "Prompt chaining is a technique that involves breaking down a workflow into a series of known steps. Then orchestrates each step (typically involve an LLM invocation) to handle the output generated from the previous step. Within the worklow, there could be one or more conditional steps which determines the the trajectory of the workflow based on the given state.\n",

    "## Summary: Prompt Chaining Agentic Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we successfully implemented a **prompt chaining agentic workflow** using Strands Agent to process legal contracts and generate professional email communications. This demonstrates how multiple AI agents can work together in sequence, with each agent's output serving as input to the next agent in the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components Built\n",
    "\n",
    "**Four Specialized Agents:**\n",
    "   - **Concern Finder Agent** - Analyzes contracts for risks in data privacy, SLAs, and liability caps\n",
    "   - **Email Writer Agent** - Drafts professional corporate emails based on legal concerns\n",
    "   - **Email Reviewer Agent** - Reviews emails for tone, clarity, and professionalism\n",
    "   - **Email Rewriter Agent** - Incorporates feedback to produce polished final emails\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt chaining workflow follows this sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Legal Contract (S3) â†’ Concern Analysis â†’ Email Draft â†’ Email Review â†’ Final Email\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Retrieval**: Contract is fetched from S3 storage\n",
    "2. **Risk Analysis**: Legal concerns are identified and structured in XML format\n",
    "3. **Email Drafting**: Professional email is created based on identified concerns\n",
    "4. **Quality Review**: Email is analyzed for improvements in tone and clarity\n",
    "5. **Final Refinement**: Email is rewritten incorporating all feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits of Prompt Chaining\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Specialization**: Each agent focuses on a specific task, leading to higher quality outputs\n",
    "- **Iterative Improvement**: Multiple rounds of refinement produce superior final results\n",
    "- **Modularity**: Individual agents can be modified or replaced without affecting the entire workflow\n",
    "- **Transparency**: Each step is logged and visible, making the process auditable\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Additional agents can be easily added to extend the workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structured Data Flow**: XML tags ensure consistent data formatting between agents\n",
    "- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling prevents workflow failures\n",
    "- **Logging Integration**: INFO-level logging provides detailed workflow visibility\n",
    "- **AWS Integration**: Seamless S3 document retrieval with proper authentication\n",
    "- **Model Flexibility**: Uses Amazon Nova models but can be adapted for other LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern can be applied to various business scenarios:\n",
    "- **Contract Analysis**: Legal document review and risk assessment\n",
    "- **Content Creation**: Multi-stage content development and refinement\n",
    "- **Customer Communications**: Automated professional correspondence\n",
    "- **Document Processing**: Complex document transformation workflows\n",
    "- **Quality Assurance**: Multi-layered review and improvement processes\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab demonstrates the power of breaking complex tasks into specialized, chained operations that leverage the strengths of multiple AI agents working in concert."
