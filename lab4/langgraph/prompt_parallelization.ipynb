    "# Prompt Parallelization Workflow\n",
    "In this notebook, we will build a content moderation system specifically designed for media and entertainment companies using the Prompt Parallelization pattern with Langgraph Agent. This pattern allows us to process media content through multiple specialized LLM prompts in parallel and then aggregate the results.\n",

    "At a high level, we'll be creating a media content moderation system that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Takes content as input (scripts, user comments, social posts, etc.)\n",

    "  - Misleading content identification and copyright concerns\n",
