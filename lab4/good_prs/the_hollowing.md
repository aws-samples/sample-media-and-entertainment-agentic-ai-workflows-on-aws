## **SYNOPSIS: WHEN THE COUNT BEGINS**  
Five days ago, the Harper family moved to the remote town of Blackvale, seeking peace after tragedy. Five hours ago, they discovered the basement. Five minutes ago, they heard the whispers. Now, they have until dawn to break the curse… or become the fifth generation claimed by **The Hollowing**.  

Rooted in a chilling real-world legend, the film follows single mother **Dr. Elena Harper** ([Lead Actor’s Name]) and her twin teenagers as they unravel the town’s ghastly secret: every 50 years, five souls must be hollowed out to feed an unspeakable entity buried beneath Blackvale. But this time, the ritual is breaking its rules. The walls are bleeding. The shadows are counting. And the fifth victim… might already be *inside the house*.

## **WHY THIS FILM WILL HAUNT YOU**  
- **THE “5” PHENOMENON**: A curse that toys with time, reality, and the human psyche—where every death ties to the number 5.  
- **UNSEEN TERRORS**: Shot using revolutionary "subliminal horror" cinematography, with frames hidden in the flicker of candlelight and whispers layered beneath silence.  
- **A TRUE LEGEND**: Inspired by centuries-old Appalachian folklore about “The Fifth Face,” a deity that demands sacrifice through exponential dread.  

**WARNING**: Early test screenings reported audiences refusing to turn off lights, check clocks, or be alone for days.
