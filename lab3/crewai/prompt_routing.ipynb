    "# Building an intelligent LLM Routing System using CrewAI\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build an LLM workflow using [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/) for intelligent routing. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case\n",
    "Sales and marketing teams face diverse processing needsâ€”from creative content generation to data-driven analysis to customer communications. Each of these tasks benefits from models with different strengths. Rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach, our routing system will analyze incoming requests, categorize them, and direct them to specialized models that excel at specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using langgraph, we'll be enable an LLM workflow that perform the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classify incoming requests by type and intent\n",
    "- Create a decision framework that maps request categories to appropriate models\n",
    "- Implement routing logic that directs requests to the optimal model\n",
